 * which is currently the root of the droid-Security-Thesis workspace). Furthermore, it provides the possibility to
 * clean the output, that was created by the tools. This may be .txt, .xml files or other folders with reports. This
 * comes in handy if you want to run the analysis on bigger data sets.
 *
 * The Interface gets implemented by the abstract Tool class which is in turn extended by a class for each tool e.g.
 * FlowDroidTool. So we can use polymorphism here.
