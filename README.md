*Idea: Benchmarking Android Data Leak Detection Tools (Claudio Corrodi, Timo 
Spring, Mohammad Ghafari, and Oscar Nierstrasz)*

June 25: The basic implementation is in this branch (essos), however, we are 
in the process of updating several parts and making it easier to configure and 
set up the benchmark. More will follow in the upcoming days and weeks and will 
eventually be merged into the master branch.
